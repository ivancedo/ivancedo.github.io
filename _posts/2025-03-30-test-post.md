# Welcome to My Blog!

Hey there! I'm Iván, an engineering student specializing in telecommunications, and I've decided to start this blog to share my journey into the world of cybersecurity.

Here, you'll find a bit of everything: 
- **CTF write-ups** – because there's nothing like the thrill of solving a tough challenge.
- **Tool development** – I'll be coding my own security tools and breaking down how they work.
- **Real-world cases** – analyzing breaches, attacks, and how they went down.
- **Random cybersecurity thoughts** – because sometimes you just need to rant about bad security practices.

I’m not here to be formal or overly technical (unless the topic demands it). This blog is just a space for me to document my learning, share cool stuff, and hopefully help others along the way.

If you're into hacking, security research, or just tech in general, stick around – it’s gonna be fun!

Cheers,
Iván
